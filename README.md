# SmartVeggieBillingSystem
The purpose of this project is to automate the process of billing system of vegetables. Raspberry PI is the heart of this project which monitors all the components in the system. Initially we capture the different vegetables images and train the AI model with images. These images are used to recognize the vegetables taken by the customer. Camera captures the selected item image and AI model based on Convolution neural network recognize this image using image recognition technique. Image recognition is not only the technique to find the vegetable, using resistance of the vegetable we can recognize the vegetable. Resistance method of recognizing the vegetable is not suitable because it may cause the damage to the vegetables. So we choose image recognition method. Weight of the item is also measured using the sensor which removes the human intervention in weighing the item. Recognized item and its weight is going to display on the screen. Customer can add or delete the items using User Interface. Finally, a bill is created based on the selected items of the customer
